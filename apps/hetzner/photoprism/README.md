# Hetzner Cloud PhotoPrism

<img src="images/photoprism-logo.png" height="100px">

[PhotoPrism](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/) turns your server into a ready-to-go photo solution with AI functionality.
It uses the latest technologies to automatically tag and find images without getting in your way.

You can install PhotoPrism via the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud) or the [Hetzner Cloud API](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#servers-create-a-server).

## Getting Started

Create your server as usual using the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud). As an alternative to the operating system, you can choose an app that you would like to have pre-installed.

The collection is preinstalled on the server in the form of [Docker images](https://www.docker.com/), but it is not activated.

To activate the collection, please login to your server:

- By _SSH key_, if you provided one when you created your server.
- By _root password_, which you received from us by email when you created your server, if no SSH key was provided.

This will take you through a process whereby you can then use any services from the web, with automatic Let's Encrypt support.

## Hetzner Cloud API

Instead of the Hetzner Cloud Console, the Hetzner Cloud API can also be used to set up a server with PhotoPrism.

- For example via curl command from the command line

  ```
  curl \
     -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "my-photoprism-server", "server_type": "cpx21", "image": "photoprism"}' \
     'https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers'
  ```

- Or via [hcloud-cli](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)

  ```
  hcloud server create --name my-photoprism-server --type cpx21 --image photoprism
  ```
