# Hetzner Cloud Ruby

<img src="images/ruby-logo.png" height="97px">

This app contains a ready to use Ruby installation.
You can install it via the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud) or the [Hetzner Cloud API](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#servers-create-a-server).

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

## Getting started

Create your server on our [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud). Instead of an image, you will be able to choose the app that you would like to have preinstalled on your server.

Ruby is preinstalled when the image is booted.

You can log into your server as usual:

- Via _SSH key_, if you selected one when you created the server
- Via _root password_, which will be mailed to you if you created a server without selecting an SSH key

## Hetzner Cloud API

In addition to the Hetzner Cloud Console you can also use the Hetzner Cloud API to set up a server with pre-installed Ruby.

- For example with a curl command via CLI

  ```
  curl \
  	-X POST \
  	-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  	-d '{"name":"my-server", "server_type":"cx31", "image":"ruby"}' \
  	'https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers'
  ```

- Or via [hcloud-cli](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)

  ```
  hcloud server create --name my-server --type cx31 --image ruby
  ```
